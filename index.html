  <h2>Education</h2>
  <ul>
    <h3>
      <li>The first subject that interests me is Science and Technology. I was interested because when I watch in youtube, I always search for D.I.Y technologies and some projects like creating a whirlpool by using 2 plastic bottles with a water in
        it, and some this like adding baking soda to vinegar which its building up carbon dioxide that make the balloon inflate automaticaly.</li>
    </h3>
    <br>
    <h3>
      <li>The second subject I like is Math. I know that sometimes we find it really hard and we can't use calculators in School, (calculators are really forbidden in Schools because its cheating) because when I am learning some Math problems it is
        making my mind think faser because of the pressure but it makes us capable of thinking fast and doing somethings that no other people can imagine.</li>
    </h3>
    <br>
    <h3>
      <li>The thing I really want to learn is creating website and apps(website learning games for my new Nephew so he can learn how to do math and read). I want to help children to grow up succesful for their life and their family.</li>
    </h3>
